Time Complexity:O(V)

Space Complexity:O(1)
We will keep a pointer at the end of the array i. Now while(V >= coins[i]) we will reduce V by coins[i] and add it to the ans array.

We will also ignore the coins which are greater than V and the coins which are less than V. We consider them and reduce the value of V by coins[I].



import java.util.*;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int V = 49;
    ArrayList < Integer > ans = new ArrayList < > ();
    int coins[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, 1000};
    int n = coins.length;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      while (V >= coins[i]) {
        V -= coins[i];
        ans.add(coins[i]);
      }
    }
    System.out.println("The minimum number of coins is "+ans.size());
    System.out.println("The coins are ");
    for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++) {
      System.out.print(" " + ans.get(i));
    }

  }
}
